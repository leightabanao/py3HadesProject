"Pacman"

The program will let users play a game wherein they will control Pacman, a yellow ball, and is tasked to collect all the cookies (yellow dots) in a maze. However, there are ghosts (pink, orange, red, cyan squares) roaming the maze, which the player shall help Pacman evade, as touching these ghosts will result in a game over.
