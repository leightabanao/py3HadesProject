## Multi Pac-Man

In this game, play as the ever-lovable and classic game character Pac-Man!

But... OH NO!

It seems other game universes and some of the characters within have started "leaking" into the maze.

Well, worry you must not, as Pac-Man can still able to do his job and collect all the pellets in the maze. His power pellets also remain intact and can still help him eat these powerful otherworldy creatures, eradicating them from his world. However, he still only have 3 lives. So you must help him evade these creatures when his powerup is not up yet.

Join him as he venture into this predicament anywhere or anywhich universe it is.
