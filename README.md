"Multi Pac-Man"

The project proposed by the students is a Python recreation of the classic hit game Pac-Man, but with some twists from other classic video games. The students also propose the usage of the Python library “Pygame” alongside the lessons of the course program, to improve the graphics for the game.

For a brief description of the original game: the player will be controlling Pac-Man, a yellow ball tasked to collect/eat all the cookies (yellow dots) in a maze as quickly as possible. However, in the game, there are ghosts, colored pink, orange, red, and cyan, roaming the maze. The player shall help Pac-Man evade, as touching these ghosts will result in losing a “life.”  The game is over when all of Pac-Man’s lives are lost, and the score is based on the number of cookies that have been eaten.

The proponents have decided that the twist or unique mechanic of this game recreation would be the addition of multiple continuous pages and/or screen scrolling, akin to other classic video games such as Super Mario Bros and The Legend of Zelda. This is where the title of the project, “Multi Pac-Man,” comes from. Furthermore, if time permits, the students might redesign the other “screens/pages” into the theme of Super Mario Bros. and/or Zelda, adding “multiversal travel” into the theme of the game, further fitting the title “Multi Pac-Man.”

Thus, the technical objectives / features of the game project are:
- To recreate the game Pac-Man using the Python programming language,
- To implement the multi-screen and/or screen scrolling feature seen in Platformer and JRPGs game genres into Pac-Man,
- (Optional) To incorporate a level/stage progression similar to the original games, and
- (Optional) To design a multiverse-like multi-screen maze, with different game universes serving as the other screens/“pages.”
